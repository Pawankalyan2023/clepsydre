Clepsydre (temporary name)

This is a presentation timer, meant to be run in full screen on any browser.

The screen fills up from the bottom to give a clear indication of the time remaining. Once the screen is filled up, the time is over.
The colors change too :
- from 0 to 80% it's blue: you have time
- from 80% to 90% it turns green. You still have time.
- from 90% to 95% it turns yellow, hurry up.
- from 95% to 100% it turns red, your time is almost over.

Demo here (20 seconds timer) : https://zenika-open-source.github.io/clepsydre/?duration=20s

There is a wakelock to prevent the phone from going to sleep that should work. Be mindful of your phone since it will stay unlocked.

This project is greatly inspired from the Android app [Presentation Timer from Neuron Digital](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neurondigital.presentationtimer&hl=fr).
Unfortunately this app only exists on Android and I thought it could be useful on iphones and other devices too.
